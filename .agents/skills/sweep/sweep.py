threads where USER spoke last, APPROVE_EMOJI reacts from USER, and MEMORY_REPO's
open-PR count. A finding is marked 👀 when the pipeline has reacted to say it
received it. AGENTS.md is the ground truth: its Config section names USER, the
repos and the emoji, and its rules say what to do with a finding.
